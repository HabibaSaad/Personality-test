A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual’s distinct personality traits. In most instances,
your personality will influence relationships with your family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your health and well-being.


One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality Test. This personality test asks a serious of questions to rate your likes and 
dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a blue, green, orange or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually
a student will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to type cast a student, but it allows teachers to understand the personality 
attributes associated with various students. You will operate as one primary color for the most part,
but high levels of stress and other environmental factors can shift your personality type for short intervals. As a rule of
thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes and keep in mind the attributes that irritate people.
